# Contributing to UseAgent

Thanks for helping. This page gets you from a fresh clone to a merged pull request.

## Pick an issue

- Browse [`good first issue`](https://github.com/useagenthq/useagent/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  for something you can finish in a few hours, or
  [`hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/useagenthq/useagent/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest)
  for the full Hacktoberfest list.
- Comment on the issue that you're taking it. If nobody has pushed anything after a week,
  the issue is open again.
- Something not listed? Open an issue first and describe the change, so we can agree on the
  shape before you write it.

## Set up

You need [bun](https://bun.sh) (never npm) and Postgres 16+ with
[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector). The README's
[Get started](README.md#get-started) section has the commands. Each package installs on its
own; there are no workspaces.

Most UI and backend work needs no sandbox or model key: the tests run against a throwaway
database and fakes. A real agent run needs a sandbox provider key (Daytona is the easiest)
and a model key; see the [setup guide](https://useagent.org/docs/getting-started/quickstart/).

## Before you open a pull request

Run what CI runs:

```bash
bun run typecheck                 # from the repo root, covers every package
cd backend && bun run test        # uses its own throwaway database
cd frontend && bun run test && bun run lint
```

- Keep a pull request to one change. Small pull requests get reviewed fast.
- Add or update a test for the behaviour you changed.
- Match the code around you. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and, for UI work,
  [`frontend/AGENTS.md`](frontend/AGENTS.md) first.
- User-visible text: plain words, no em dashes.
- Commit subjects in the imperative ("Add the Discord transport"), no `type(scope):` prefixes.

## Where things plug in

| You want to add | Start from |
|---|---|
| A messaging channel (Discord, Telegram, Teams) | [`backend/src/connectors/`](backend/src/connectors/): the `Transport` and `Renderer` contracts in `types.ts`, with `email/` as the worked example |
| A sandbox provider | [`packages/sandbox-contract`](packages/sandbox-contract) and the provider packages next to it; [`packages/conformance`](packages/conformance) is the acceptance suite |
| A UI component | [`frontend/components/base/`](frontend/components/base/), the shared kit; compose it rather than writing a new one |
| Docs | [`docs-site/`](docs-site/README.md) |

## Hacktoberfest

Merged, approved or `hacktoberfest-accepted` pull requests count. Pull requests that only
reformat, rename or add noise get the `spam` label and do not count.
